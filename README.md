**Subject:** `Revolutionary Cooling Technology for Microsoft's Carbon Negative Goals`
**To:** mspress@microsoft.com, azure-info@microsoft.com

```
Dear Microsoft Azure Leadership Team,

Microsoft's commitment to becoming carbon negative by 2030 positions you as the sustainability leader in cloud computing. I'm writing to introduce a breakthrough technology that could accelerate this timeline while delivering massive operational savings.

The Convective Heat Engine (CHE) offers Azure:
• Elimination of water cooling energy costs (30-50% of facility power)
• Dramatic reduction in water consumption through innovative heat management
• Potential for waste heat recovery and ecosystem benefits
• $1-3B annual savings across Azure's 200+ datacenter fleet

This technology perfectly aligns with your sustainability commitments and could support Azure's leadership in sustainable AI infrastructure.

I've attached a detailed executive brief outlining the technology, implementation strategy, and financial impact.

The technology has theoretical validation from Professor Ira M. Katz (published fluid mechanics expert), but requires funding for detailed modeling and validation.

Could we schedule a 30-minute call to discuss funding opportunities for this breakthrough cooling technology?

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your title]
[Your contact information]

P.S. This technology works by harnessing natural atmospheric processes - it's engineering that works WITH nature instead of fighting it.
```

### Template 3: AGI/AI Company Focus
**Subject:** `Revolutionary Cooling Technology for AGI Training Infrastructure`
**To:** partnerships@[company].com, press@[company].com

```
Dear [Company] Leadership Team,

The race to AGI requires unprecedented computational power, but traditional datacenter cooling is becoming a bottleneck. Training large language models and AGI systems demands massive infrastructure that's often limited by cooling capacity and energy costs.

The Convective Heat Engine (CHE) offers [Company]:
• Elimination of water cooling energy costs (30-50% of facility power)
• Dramatic reduction in training infrastructure operational costs
• Enabling larger, more intensive AGI training runs
• Sustainable scaling of AI compute without energy constraints

With theoretical validation from Professor Ira M. Katz (published fluid mechanics expert), CHE could be the breakthrough that enables cost-effective AGI development at scale.

[Company]'s pursuit of AGI requires revolutionary infrastructure. Traditional cooling systems weren't designed for the intensive, continuous compute loads of modern AI training.

We're seeking funding for comprehensive modeling and validation studies. This could position [Company] as the first AGI company with truly sustainable, cost-effective training infrastructure.

Would you be interested in a brief presentation on how CHE can accelerate your path to AGI?

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your title]
[Your contact information]

P.S. The first company to deploy CHE could gain massive competitive advantages in the AGI race through reduced training costs.

### Template 4: Meta Focus
**Subject:** `Revolutionary Cooling Technology for Meta's $10B Louisiana Datacenter`
**To:** press@meta.com, partnerships@meta.com

```
Dear Meta Infrastructure Leadership Team,

Meta's $10B investment in Louisiana demonstrates unprecedented commitment to AI infrastructure scaling. However, traditional cooling systems could limit the efficiency and sustainability of this massive facility expansion.

The Convective Heat Engine (CHE) offers Meta:
• Elimination of water cooling energy costs (30-50% of facility power)
• Dramatic reduction in infrastructure operational costs for AI training
• Support for your 100% renewable energy commitment and net-zero by 2030 goals
• Enhanced capacity for your four-division AI strategy expansion

With theoretical validation from Professor Ira M. Katz (published fluid mechanics expert), CHE could be the infrastructure breakthrough that enables Meta's AI ambitions at unprecedented scale.

Your Louisiana facility represents the largest datacenter investment in Meta's history. Traditional cooling systems weren't designed for the intensive AI workloads you're planning.

We're seeking funding for comprehensive modeling and validation studies. This could position Meta as the first major tech company with truly sustainable, cost-effective AI infrastructure.

Given the scale of your Louisiana investment, even modest efficiency improvements represent massive value creation. CHE can deliver transformational improvements.

Would you be interested in a brief presentation on how CHE can support Meta's AI infrastructure goals?

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your title]
[Your contact information]

P.S. With $10B invested in Louisiana, infrastructure efficiency could determine the long-term success of Meta's AI strategy.
