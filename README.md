## 📧 Email Templates (Copy & Paste)

### Template 1: Microsoft Focus
**Subject:** `Revolutionary Cooling Technology for Microsoft's Carbon Negative Goals`
**To:** mspress@microsoft.com, azure-info@microsoft.com

```
Dear Microsoft Azure Leadership Team,

Microsoft's commitment to becoming carbon negative by 2030 positions you as the sustainability leader in cloud computing. I'm writing to introduce a breakthrough technology that could accelerate this timeline while delivering massive operational savings.

The Convective Heat Engine (CHE) offers Azure:
• 40-70% reduction in cooling energy consumption
• 80-90% reduction in water usage
• Self-generating renewable power
• $500M-1B annual cost savings potential

This technology perfectly aligns with your sustainability commitments and could support Azure's leadership in sustainable AI infrastructure.

I've attached a detailed executive brief outlining the technology, implementation strategy, and financial impact.

Could we schedule a 30-minute call to discuss how CHE can support Azure's carbon negative goals?

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your title]
[Your contact information]

P.S. This technology works by harnessing natural atmospheric processes - it's engineering that works WITH nature instead of fighting it.
```

### Template 2: Amazon Focus
**Subject:** `Revolutionary Cooling Technology for AWS's $15B Infrastructure Expansion`
**To:** press@amazon.com, aws-infrastructure@amazon.com

```
Dear AWS Infrastructure Leadership Team,

AWS's recent $15B investment in Japan demonstrates your commitment to meeting explosive AI demand. However, traditional cooling systems may limit the efficiency and sustainability of this expansion.

The Convective Heat Engine (CHE) offers AWS:
• 40-70% reduction in cooling energy across your 32-region infrastructure
• 80-90% reduction in water consumption (critical for global operations)
• Self-generating renewable power adding 500-1,500MW to your portfolio
• $1-2B annual operational savings potential

This technology perfectly aligns with the Climate Pledge while supporting AWS's infrastructure leadership.

Given AWS's scale (15,000+ MW capacity), even a 10% efficiency improvement represents massive impact. CHE can deliver 40-70% improvements.

Could we schedule a brief call to discuss how CHE supports AWS's expansion while advancing Climate Pledge goals?

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your title]
[Your contact information]
```

### Template 3: Sustainability Focus (Any Company)
**Subject:** `Water-Positive Datacenter Technology Supporting Climate Commitments`
**To:** sustainability@[company].com

```
Dear [Company] Sustainability Team,

[Company]'s climate commitments inspire the industry, but achieving net-zero requires breakthrough technologies, especially for datacenter operations.

The Convective Heat Engine addresses two critical challenges:
1. Datacenter cooling energy (30-50% of total consumption)
2. Water usage (3-5M gallons/day per large facility)

CHE benefits for climate goals:
• Eliminate 60-80% of cooling-related emissions
• Generate renewable power (water-positive operations)
• Reduce water consumption by 80-90%
• Enable expansion in water-constrained regions

This technology could accelerate [Company]'s path to net-zero while providing competitive advantages in sustainable cloud services.

Would you be interested in a brief presentation on how CHE can support your climate objectives?

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your title]
[Your contact information]
