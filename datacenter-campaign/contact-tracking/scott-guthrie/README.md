### LinkedIn Message (Primary Approach)
```
Hi Scott,

Your leadership in Azure's AI infrastructure expansion is impressive, but the cooling bottleneck is becoming critical. AI workloads are driving 300-500% increases in datacenter energy consumption.

The Convective Heat Engine could eliminate this bottleneck entirely:
‚Ä¢ Complete elimination of water cooling energy costs (30-50% of facility power)
‚Ä¢ Enable higher density AI workloads without thermal constraints  
‚Ä¢ Theoretical validation from Professor Ira M. Katz (published fluid mechanics expert)

Given Azure's 200+ datacenters, this represents $1-3B in annual savings potential while accelerating your carbon-negative 2030 goals.

We're seeking $2-5M funding for comprehensive modeling and validation. Would you be interested in a brief technical presentation?

The first cloud provider to deploy this could gain decisive infrastructure advantages in the AI race.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```
