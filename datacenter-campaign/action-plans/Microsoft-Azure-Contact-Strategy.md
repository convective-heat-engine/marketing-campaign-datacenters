Subject: Revolutionary Datacenter Cooling Solution for Microsoft's Sustainability Goals

Dear Microsoft Azure Leadership Team,

Microsoft's commitment to becoming carbon negative by 2030 positions you as the sustainability leader in cloud computing. I'm writing to introduce a breakthrough technology that could accelerate this timeline while delivering massive operational savings.

The Convective Heat Engine (CHE) offers Azure:
‚Ä¢ 40-70% reduction in cooling energy consumption
‚Ä¢ 80-90% reduction in water usage
‚Ä¢ Self-generating renewable power
‚Ä¢ $500M-1B annual cost savings potential

This technology perfectly aligns with your nuclear power initiative and sustainability commitments. We'd like to propose a pilot program at 2-3 Azure facilities to demonstrate these benefits.

I've attached a detailed executive brief outlining the technology, implementation strategy, and financial impact.

Could we schedule a 30-minute call to discuss how CHE can support Azure's leadership in sustainable AI infrastructure?

Best regards,
[Your name and credentials]
