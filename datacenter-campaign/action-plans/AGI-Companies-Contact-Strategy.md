Subject: Revolutionary Cooling Technology for AGI Training Infrastructure

Dear [Company] Team,

The race to AGI requires unprecedented computational power, but traditional datacenter cooling is becoming the primary bottleneck. Training large language models and AGI systems demands massive infrastructure that's often limited by cooling capacity and operational costs.

The Convective Heat Engine (CHE) could eliminate this bottleneck:
• Complete elimination of water cooling energy costs (30-50% of facility power)
• Enable larger, more intensive AGI training runs
• Dramatic reduction in training infrastructure operational costs
• Sustainable scaling of AI compute without traditional energy constraints

With theoretical validation from Professor Ira M. Katz (published fluid mechanics expert), CHE represents the infrastructure breakthrough that could determine AGI leadership.

[Company]'s pursuit of AGI requires revolutionary infrastructure. We're seeking $3-5M funding for comprehensive modeling and validation studies specifically optimized for AGI training workloads.

The first company to deploy CHE could gain decisive advantages in the AGI race through dramatically reduced training costs and enhanced compute capacity.

Would you be interested in a brief presentation on how CHE can accelerate your path to AGI?

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your credentials]
[Contact information]

P.S. Traditional cooling systems weren't designed for the intensive, continuous compute loads of modern AGI development. CHE changes the entire economic equation.
```
