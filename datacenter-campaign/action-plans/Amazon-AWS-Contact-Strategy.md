3. Share executive brief as thought leadership content
4. Use hashtags: #AWS #Sustainability #ClimateChange #DatacentersEmail: karahurst@amazon.com

**Sample LinkedIn Post:**
```
ðŸš€ AWS's $15B investment in Japan shows incredible commitment to cloud infrastructure expansion. 

But with AI workloads driving 400% increases in energy consumption, traditional cooling is becoming a bottleneck.

The Convective Heat Engine could be AWS's secret weapon:
âš¡ 40-70% reduction in cooling energy costs
ðŸ’§ 80-90% less water consumption  
ðŸŒ± Self-generating renewable power
ðŸ’° $1-2B annual savings potential across AWS fleet

@andyjassy @peterdesantis - this technology aligns perfectly with the Climate Pledge while boosting operational efficiency at massive scale.

Perfect complement to your infrastructure expansion strategy.

#### Twitter/X Strategy
**Daily Actions:**
1. Reply to Andy Jassy's posts about AWS growth and sustainability
2. Share CHE benefits tagging @ajassy @aws
3. Engage with #AWSReInvent and #ClimateChange hashtags

### Week 2: Direct Outreach

#### Email Campaign
**Primary Email:** press@amazon.com, aws-infrastructure@amazon.com
**Subject:** "Revolutionary Cooling Technology for AWS's $15B Infrastructure Expansion"

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Revolutionary Cooling Technology for AWS's $15B Infrastructure Expansion

Dear AWS Infrastructure Leadership Team,

AWS's recent $15B investment in Japan demonstrates your commitment to meeting explosive AI demand. However, traditional cooling systems may limit the efficiency and sustainability of this expansion.

The Convective Heat Engine (CHE) offers AWS:
â€¢ 40-70% reduction in cooling energy across your 32-region infrastructure
â€¢ 80-90% reduction in water consumption (critical for global operations)
â€¢ Self-generating renewable power adding 500-1,500MW to your portfolio
â€¢ $1-2B annual operational savings potential

This technology perfectly aligns with the Climate Pledge while supporting AWS's infrastructure leadership. We'd like to propose pilot deployments at 2-3 strategic facilities to demonstrate these benefits.

Given AWS's scale (15,000+ MW capacity), even a 10% efficiency improvement represents massive impact. CHE can deliver 40-70% improvements.

I've attached a detailed analysis of CHE's potential impact on AWS operations, including financial modeling and implementation strategy.

Could we schedule a brief call to discuss how CHE supports AWS's expansion while advancing Climate Pledge goals?

Best regards,
[Your name and credentials]

**Sustainability Team Email:** sustainability@amazon.com
**Subject:** "Water-Positive Datacenter Technology Supporting Climate Pledge Goals"

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Water-Positive Datacenter Technology Supporting Climate Pledge Goals

Dear AWS Sustainability Team,

Amazon's Climate Pledge leadership inspires the industry, but achieving net-zero by 2040 requires breakthrough technologies, especially for datacenter operations.

The Convective Heat Engine addresses two critical challenges:
1. Datacenter cooling energy (30-50% of total consumption)
2. Water usage (3-5M gallons/day per large facility)

CHE benefits for Climate Pledge goals:
â€¢ Eliminate 60-80% of cooling-related emissions
â€¢ Generate renewable power (water-positive operations)
â€¢ Reduce water consumption by 80-90%
â€¢ Enable expansion in water-constrained regions

This technology could accelerate AWS's path to net-zero while providing competitive advantages in sustainable cloud services.

I've attached a sustainability impact analysis showing potential carbon and water savings across AWS's global infrastructure.

Would you be interested in a brief presentation on how CHE can support Climate Pledge objectives?

Best regards,
[Your name]
