## 📞 What to Do When They Say...

### "Send me more information"
**Response:** "I'll send our executive brief right now. When could we schedule a 20-minute call to discuss how this applies specifically to [Company]'s infrastructure?"

### "We're not looking for new cooling solutions"
**Response:** "I understand. This isn't traditional cooling - it actually generates renewable power while cooling more efficiently. Given [Company]'s [sustainability goal], it might be worth a brief look. Could I send a 2-page summary?"

### "What's your pricing?"
