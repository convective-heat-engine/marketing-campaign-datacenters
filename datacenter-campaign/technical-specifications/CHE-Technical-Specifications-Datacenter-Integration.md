# Convective Heat Engine (CHE) Technical Specifications for Datacenter Integration

## System Overview

The Convective Heat Engine represents a paradigm shift in datacenter operations, creating the world's first energy self-sufficient datacenter ecosystem. The CHE utilizes datacenter waste heat to power the entire facility while generating surplus water for ecosystem restoration. This document provides comprehensive technical specifications for complete datacenter-CHE integration.

## Core Technology Principles

### 1. Atmospheric Thermal Dynamics
**Fundamental Physics:**
- Exploits the atmospheric lapse rate (temperature decrease with altitude)
- Creates artificial thermal columns using incompressible fluid circulation
- Generates controlled convective uplift through thermal stratification

**Key Innovation:**
The CHE creates a closed-loop energy system where datacenter waste heat drives the CHE, which generates all the electricity needed by the datacenter. Unlike air (compressible fluid), water (incompressible fluid) in vertical columns thermally separates opposite to the atmosphere, enabling complete energy self-sufficiency through waste heat utilization.
