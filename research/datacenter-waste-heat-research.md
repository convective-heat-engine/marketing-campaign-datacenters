# Datacenter Waste Heat Generation Research

## Executive Summary

Datacenters are massive consumers of electricity, with nearly all consumed energy ultimately converted to waste heat. This represents both a significant environmental challenge and a substantial opportunity for energy recovery and reuse.

## Key Statistics

### Global Energy Consumption
- **Global Share**: Datacenters account for approximately 1-2% of global electricity consumption
- **US Consumption**: 4.4% of US electricity in 2023, projected to reach up to 12% by 2028
- **European Consumption**: 104 TWh in 2020 (3% of total electricity use)
- **Germany Specific**: Over 13 TWh converted to heat annually

### Waste Heat Generation Calculations
- **1 MW IT Power**: Generates approximately 1.3 MW of total heat
- **Heat Output**: A datacenter consuming 1 MW can generate ~850 kW of recoverable waste heat (85% efficiency)
- **Heating Capacity**: Waste heat from a datacenter can warm buildings 10-30x the size of the datacenter itself
- **Temperature Range**: Most datacenter waste heat is generated at 25-40°C (77-104°F)

### Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)
- **Efficient Datacenters**: PUE of 1.2 means 1,200W total facility power for every 1,000W of IT equipment
- **Heat Distribution**: In a PUE 1.2 facility, ~1,000W converts to waste heat from IT equipment alone

### Heat Recovery Potential by Region

#### Northern Europe
- **Advantage**: Existing district heating infrastructure
- **Climate**: Cold climate increases heating demand
- **Examples**: Helsinki underground datacenter heats ~500 large houses

#### Temperature Considerations
- **Low-Grade Heat**: 25-40°C output suitable for district heating
- **Seasonal Demand**: Higher value in cold climates with heating seasons
- **Infrastructure**: Requires proximity to heat distribution networks

## Technical Specifications

### Heat Generation Formula
```
Total Heat Output = IT Power Load × PUE
Recoverable Heat ≈ IT Power Load × 0.85-0.95
```

### Typical Datacenter Specifications
- **Small Enterprise**: 100-500 kW
- **Medium Enterprise**: 500-2,000 kW  
- **Large Enterprise**: 2-10 MW
- **Hyperscale**: 10-100+ MW

### Heat Recovery Efficiency
- **Water Cooling**: Can capture 60-80% of waste heat
- **Air Cooling**: Typically captures 30-50% of waste heat
- **Optimal Temperature**: Heat pumps can upgrade low-grade heat for higher temperature applications
