# Datacenter Heat Recovery Research

This directory contains comprehensive research on existing datacenters and their waste heat generation potential.

## Research Files

### [Datacenter Waste Heat Research](./datacenter-waste-heat-research.md)
Comprehensive analysis of datacenter waste heat generation, including:
- Global energy consumption statistics
- Heat generation calculations and formulas
- Technical specifications and efficiency metrics
- Market drivers and challenges
- Future outlook and recommendations

**Key Finding**: Datacenters generate 0.85-1.3 MW of waste heat per MW of IT power, sufficient to heat buildings 10-30x their size.

### [Major Datacenter Facilities](./major-datacenter-facilities.md)
Detailed overview of existing datacenter facilities worldwide, including:
- Hyperscale operators (AWS, Microsoft, Google, Meta)
- Major colocation providers (Digital Realty, Equinix, NTT)
- Regional mega-facilities and their specifications
- Heat generation potential by facility type
- Geographic analysis of heat recovery opportunities

**Key Finding**: Hyperscale facilities (10-100+ MW) can generate 8.5-85+ MW of recoverable heat, enough for entire neighborhoods.

### [Heat Recovery Case Studies](./datacenter-heat-recovery-case-studies.md)
Real-world examples of successful datacenter heat recovery implementations:
- Stockholm Data Parks (10% of city heating by 2035)
- Meta's Odense facility (100,000 MWh/year heat recovery)
- Amazon's Dublin facility (1,400 tons CO₂ savings annually)
- Technical approaches and business models
- Economic analysis and lessons learned

**Key Finding**: Successful projects require early planning, strong partnerships, and long-term contracts.

## Executive Summary

### Scale of Opportunity
- **Global Impact**: Datacenters consume 1-2% of global electricity, with US facilities using 4.4% (projected to 12% by 2028)
- **Heat Generation**: Nearly all electrical energy converts to waste heat at 25-40°C
- **Recovery Potential**: 60-80% of waste heat can be captured with proper systems

### Economic Viability
- **Revenue Potential**: €15-60 per MWh thermal in European markets
- **Investment**: €150-1,500 per kW thermal capacity for infrastructure
- **Payback**: 3-15 years depending on market conditions and proximity to consumers

### Geographic Opportunities
- **High Potential**: Northern Europe (existing district heating), Canada, Northern US
- **Moderate Potential**: Central Europe, Japan, South Korea
- **Emerging**: China (urban density + heating demand), other cold climate regions

### Technology Trends
- **Liquid Cooling**: Higher grade heat (40-60°C) enabling better recovery
- **Heat Pumps**: Upgrading low-grade heat for higher temperature applications
- **Smart Integration**: Dynamic optimization with district heating networks

### Policy Support
- **Energy Efficiency**: Mandates driving heat recovery adoption
- **Carbon Pricing**: Improving economic viability
- **Urban Planning**: Integration requirements in some jurisdictions
